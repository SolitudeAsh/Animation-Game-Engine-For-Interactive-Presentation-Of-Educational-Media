Project Overview  

This project introduces an Animation Game Engine designed to enhance educational content delivery by making learning interactive, engaging, and adaptive. Built using the Godot Engine and GDScript, the system enables educators to create visually rich and interactive learning materials without requiring extensive programming expertise.  

Features  
- Keyframe-based animations for creating dynamic educational content  
- Real-time quizzes and feedback for interactive learning  
- Learner data analysis to track engagement and progress  
- Cross-platform support with Windows (.exe) export, and planned support for Ubuntu (Linux) and Android in the future.
- Lightweight and scalable design for accessibility across different devices  

Technologies Used  
- Godot Engine for animation and interactivity  
- GDScript for scripting and logic implementation  
- CSV data storage for capturing and analyzing user interactions
- ML Models for Data Analysis 
- Cross-platform export support  






















Detailed Instructions on how to use our project's source code


	a. If Godot is already present in your Windows PC:-
	
		1. Download our files from GitHub. Link:- https://github.com/SolitudeAsh/Animation-Game-Engine-For-Interactive-Presentation-Of-Educational-Media/tree/main

		2. Import them into the project page of Godot and run them. For automated ones, it is just like a tutorial on how the algorithm that you are trying to learn works in an animated way. Userdefined is where you will have to enter the input and implement the algorithm and after implementing, the stat will be written in the .csv file which will be created on it's own(make sure you change the path of the .csv file to your preferred location).

		3. Now after you have played it a couple of times, you can see the .csv file to have a couple of entries and stats pertaining to the player. Now, open the notebooks folder and go to new notebooks, there you will find a couple of .ipynb files related to the algorithm that you have used to learn using Godot game engine. Open them and make 
       sure the path of the .csv files are the same as that of the Godot project of userdefined. Now run the cells and you will get the predictions and the performance report and chart for your data(scores).
		
	b. If Godot is not present in your Windows PC:-
		
		1. Go to the exports folder and go into the algorithm's folder that you wish to learn about.

		2. Open the .exe file of it and play the game. For userdefined same as above , just that here the path is set to "C:\Users\username\filename.csv". Here also you do not need to create the .csv file, it will automatically be created and the values are stored as soon as you finish solving the algorithm.
